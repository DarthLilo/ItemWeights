# ItemWeights

A Lethal Company mod to easily control the item settings!

You can adjust item weights (Actual weight, not spawn weight), the scrap price ranges, and how much items in the terminal cost!

Tested and works on Lethal Company v50 and v56!

(Required on all clients)


## Usage

To use the mod, launch the game and then hold the item you wish to modify in your hand, press the assigned key ("I" by default) to add the item to the configuration file. You can now modify the weight value in the config file and the changes will take place upon restarting
